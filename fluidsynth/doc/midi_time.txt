I use this document as a memo to understand timing in MIDI files. [PH]

- MIDI Quarter Note: There is the MIDI quarter note. For those of you
  who are interested in the music notation of a MIDI file, beware, a
  MIDI quarter note in NOT necessarily equal to a notated quarter
  note.

- MIDI Clock: There are *24* MIDI clocks in a MIDI quarter note (this
  is forced upon you)

- MIDI Tempo: There are miditempo x 24th of a micro-second in a MIDI
  clock. The value of miditempo is given by the SetTempo meta-event. 

- Division: A MIDI quarter note is split into N divisions. The value
  of divisions can be found in the midifile header (MThd chunk).

- Delta-time: The time between one event and the next is called
  delta-time. The MIDI event delta-times are specified in divisions.


* How long is a MIDI Clock?

  midi-clock = miditempo * 1e-6 / 24 sec

* How long is a MIDI Quarter Note?

  quarter-note = 24 midi-clocks
               = 24 * miditempo * 1e-6 / 24 sec
               = miditempo * 1e-6 sec

* How long is a Division (a "tick" or "delta-time")?

  1 delta-time = 1 tick = quarter-note / divisions
                        = miditempo / divisions / 1e6 sec
                        = miditempo / divisions / 1000 msec


To handle music notation, two more concepts are introduced:

- There are *Nm* MIDI clocks in a metronome ticks
- There are *N32* notated 32nd notes in a MIDI quarter note

Nm and N32 can be found in the TimeSignature meta event
