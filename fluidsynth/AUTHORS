* Samuel Bianchini, Peter Hanappe and Johnathan Lee


[:Development:]

Many people contributed to FluidSynth, send suggestions or bug
fixes. The project was started by Peter Hanappe who is the main
author. Below you'll find a summery of contributions.


* Peter Hanappe. files: sticked it's hand in all files.

* Josh Green contributed a lot of code directly or indirectly through
  the Swami and Smurf code base. The soundfont loader is
  completely based on his code. He also wrote the alsa sequencer
  driver. He made many changes and bug fixes, but above all, he's one
  of the driver forces behind the synthesizer. files:
  iiwu_defsfont.{c,h}, iiwu_alsa{c,h}.

* Stephane Letz from Grame wrote most of the MidiShare driver, all of
  the PortAudio driver, ported iiwusynth to MacOS X, and sent in many
  fixes. files: iiwu_midishare.c, iiwu_portaudio.c

* Markus Nentwig (re-)designed the resonant filter, the chorus, the
  LADSPA subsystem, the MIDI router, optimized for SSE, made many
  changes and bug fixes and got the synthesizer to actually work. Most
  importantly, he used it on stage to make music.  files:
  iiwu_ladspa.{c,h}, iiwu_cmd.{c,h}, iiwu_voice.{c,h}, iiwu_synth.c,
  iiwu_sse.h, iiwu_dsp_core.h, iiwu_rev.{c,h}, and basically all the
  other files.

* Antoine Schmitt added the sequencer support, support for sample
  loading (RAM Sfont), developed the
  MacroMedia Director Xtra, and send in many many bug reports. Thanks
  to Antoine, the synthesizer finds its way to multi-media
  developers. files: in bindings/director/ and iiwu_seq.{c,h},
  iiwu_event.{c,h}, iiwu_event_priv.h, iiwu_seqbind.{c,h},
  iiwu_ramsfont.{c,h}

* Bob Ham added the code for "bank select" MIDI messages and send code
  to define the synth's ALSA sequencer client name. files:
  iiwu_midi.c, iiwu_alsa.c, iiwusynth.c, iiwusynth.h.

* Tim Goetze sent many patches and implemented the all_notes_off.
  files: iiwu_synth.c, iiwu_chan.c, iiwu_voice.c

* Norbert Schnell from Ircam's jMax Team wrote most of the jMax/FTS
  interface in a record time. He also pointed me to the technique of
  using a lookup table for the interpolation coefficients.  file:
  iiwu_fts.c, iiwu_synth.c

* The alsa driver was based on the jMax alsa driver by Francois
  Dechelle and his Real-time Team at Ircam
  (http://www.ircam.fr/jmax). The jMax code was based upon Ardour's
  alsa_device.cc by Paul Barton-Davis.  file: iiwu_alsa.c

* I copied code from the glib library to the smurf files. The goal was
  to make iiwusynth independent from any library for maximum
  portability.

* The midi device uses code from jMax's alsarawmidi.c file and from
  Smurf's midi_alsaraw.c by Josh Green. Josh also added support for
  the alsa sequencer interface. file: iiwu_alsa.c

* The reverb algorithm was written by Jezar
  (http://www.dreampoint.co.uk). His code is public domain. The code
  was translated to C by Peter Hanappe.  file: iiwu_synth.c

* The original code for the chorus effect was written by Juergen
  Mueller and sundry contributors.

* I used Martin Uddén's midi package. His files are integrated into
  the iiwu_midi file. Martin Uddén <nanook@lysator.liu.se> file:
  iiwu_midi.c

* I copied some interpolation algorihms that I found in the music-dsp
  archives (http://www.smartelectronix.com/musicdsp). They were
  written by Joshua Scholar and others.  file: iiwu_synth.c

* Bug fixes where sent in by: Werner Schweer, Dave Philips, Anthony
  Green, Jake Commander, Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano, and Raoul
  Bonisch.

* I copied the macros to {increment,decrement} the 64-bit fixed point
  phase from Mozilla's macros to handle the Long-long type (64-bit
  signed integer type). Mozilla NSPR library, www.mozilla.org.  file:
  iiwu_phase.h
